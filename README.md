# NgAnimation

This project contains the Angular animation examples. View the commit history to view and learn the evolution of code examples. Commit history is so important in this project. By the time, I will continue to add more examples.

## Want to contribute

If you want to contribute then help me to improve animation effects and add new reusable animations. Fork the project, make changes and raise the PR.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
